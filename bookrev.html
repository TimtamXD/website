                <br>
                Absolutely legendary. The Stoics have figured out what the best life is -
                one lived with virtue, based on reason. We must
                realise that most things in this life are out of our control, and therefore
                it becomes self-harming to become attached to the uncontrollable. We should focus
                on what we can control - our thoughts and our actions. And we should make it our life mission to do what benefits
                everyone, because benefiting humanity also benefits us as well. We should accept what life
                offers us, as if life were a buffet in which you could not choose which plate of food were given
                to you, and we should make the most of it. In many ways, we need to change our mindset such that each event in life is broken down
                so that we are clear in the manner in which we choose to react to it. With a fortified mind, and an unwavering pursuit of wisdom, the most
                fulfilling life can be lived.
