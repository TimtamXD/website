                    This legendary book is my favourite of all time. The Stoics have figured out what the best life is -
                    one lived with virtue, based on reason. We must
                    realise that most things in this life are out of our control, and therefore
                    it becomes self-harming to become extremely desiring of the uncontrollable. We should focus
                    on what we can control - our thoughts and our actions. And we should make it our life mission to do what benefits
                    everyone, because benefiting humanity also benefits us as well. We should accept what life
                    offers us, as if life were a buffet in which you could not choose which plate of food were given
                    to you, and we should make the most of it. In many ways, we need to change our mindset such that each event in life is broken down
                    so that we are clear in the manner in which we choose to react to it. With a fortified mind, and an unwavering pursuit of wisdom, the most
                    fulfilling life can be lived.

                    From the man who brought you quotes like "the best revenge is to not be like your enemy" and "live each day as if it were your last",
                    I bring you one more that is less known, but equally as important. This quote has a confronting simplicity to it - that life is ultimately in the end,
                    very unflattering and unimportant like a stone thrown in the air. It may be uncomfortable to accept that, yet, we realise that as a matter of experience,
                    the quote is not quite true. On this journey of ups and downs, there is so much possibility and adventure! No matter which way we go, the path we choose in life should
                    be a wise one, with virtue, and we should never forget things for what they truly are. Accept humbly, let go easily.
